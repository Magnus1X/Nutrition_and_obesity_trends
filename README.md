# Global Nutrition Transitions and Obesity Trends

## Problem Definition

To analyze how global dietary patterns and nutrition availability have evolved over time, and how these transitions relate to obesity trends among adults and children.

## Research Questions

### A. Trend-Based Questions
- How have obesity rates changed globally over the last 20–30 years?
- Are adults and children following similar or different obesity patterns over time?
- Which regions/countries show the sharpest increase or decrease in obesity?

### B. Nutrition & Diet Pattern Questions
- How has per-capita food supply (kcal, fats, sugars, proteins) changed globally?
- Is increased calorie or sugar supply associated with higher obesity rates?
- Are there specific nutrition indicators that strongly predict obesity?

### C. Inequality & Demographic Questions
- Are obesity trends different across male vs female?
- How do children vs adults differ in obesity levels across countries?
- Do age groups (if available) show different risk levels?

### D. Risk Factor Correlation Questions
- Do high-income countries show different nutrition-obesity patterns compared to low-income countries?
- Which countries are outliers (e.g., high calories but low obesity)?
- Are there clusters of countries with similar dietary and obesity profiles?

### E. Predictive Questions
- Can we predict obesity rate from nutrition supply and demographic factors?
- Which factors contribute most to obesity (feature importance)?
