# Food Supply Analysis (FAOSTAT Data)

## Overview

This analysis examines global food supply trends using FAOSTAT data across three time points (1996, 2012, 2014) and compares nutritional intake patterns across selected countries.

## Data Limitations

**Note**: Analysis is based on limited data points (1996, 2012, 2014) representing snapshots rather than comprehensive long-term trends.

## Global Nutritional Intake Trends

### Macronutrient Patterns (1996-2014)

**Energy, Fat, and Carbohydrates**
- **Peak**: 1996 showed highest global mean intake
- **Trend**: Declining pattern from 1996 → 2012 → 2014
- **Implication**: Potential shift in global dietary patterns

**Protein Intake**
- **1996-2012**: Decreased intake
- **2012-2014**: Slight recovery
- **Overall**: Remains below 1996 levels

### Key Findings
- General decreasing trend in macronutrient availability
- Protein shows more variable pattern than other nutrients
- Suggests potential global dietary transitions

## Country-Specific Analysis

### Comparative Nutritional Profiles

#### Tunisia (1996)
- **Status**: Highest intake across all macronutrients
- **Energy**: Peak levels among compared countries
- **Fat & Carbohydrates**: Substantially higher than other countries
- **Protein**: Highest recorded intake

#### Mexico (2012)
- **Status**: Moderate intake levels
- **Pattern**: Lower than Tunisia (1996), higher than Brazil (2014)
- **Protein**: Lowest among the three countries
- **Position**: Mid-range nutritional profile

#### Brazil (2014)
- **Status**: Lowest energy, fat, and carbohydrate intake
- **Protein**: Higher than Mexico, comparable to Tunisia
- **Pattern**: Most recent data showing reduced macronutrient availability

### Regional Variations

**Factors Influencing Differences**:
- Dietary habits and cultural practices
- Economic conditions and food accessibility
- Agricultural production capabilities
- Food policy and distribution systems
- Temporal changes in food systems

## Analytical Insights

### Temporal Trends
- **1996**: Higher overall nutritional availability
- **2012-2014**: Reduced macronutrient intake globally
- **Protein**: Less consistent decline pattern

### Geographic Patterns
- Significant variation between countries
- Cultural and economic factors drive differences
- Time period affects nutritional profiles

### Data Quality Considerations
- Limited temporal coverage
- Sparse country representation
- Need for more comprehensive datasets

## Implications for Obesity Research

### Current Limitations
- Insufficient data points for robust trend analysis
- Limited country coverage affects global representativeness
- Temporal gaps hinder correlation with obesity patterns

### Research Needs
- **Expanded temporal coverage**: More years of data
- **Broader geographic scope**: Additional countries
- **Consistent methodology**: Standardized measurement approaches
- **Integration potential**: Link with obesity trend data

## Conclusions

### Key Takeaways
- Global nutritional intake appears to be declining (1996-2014)
- Significant country-specific variations exist
- Protein intake shows different patterns than other macronutrients
- Cultural and economic factors strongly influence dietary patterns

### Future Directions
- Acquire more comprehensive FAOSTAT datasets
- Expand country coverage for better global representation
- Integrate food supply data with obesity trend analysis
- Investigate causal relationships between nutrition availability and obesity rates
